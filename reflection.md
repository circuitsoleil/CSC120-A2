What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I would say to someone who, like me, is new to Smith, this class, and the CS department -- asking for help is the best thing that you can do! This assignment (A2) really scared me at first. I couldn't wrap my head around OOP, and this block was compounded by feeling nervous about my coding skills compared to others. However, when speaking to classmates, and reaching out for help from my professors, I gained some confidence! After asking for what I needed, like some extra time through an extension, and visiting office hours/TA, I was able to understand the goal of this assignment. I found that once it clicked, things just started to flow. 

Next time I work on an assignment, I will definitely be pseudocoding first. Something that was hard for me with A2 was not getting to start from scratch and instead translating code into a new style. I recognize that this sort of jumping-off format is an important skill. Looking at unfinished code/someone else's code is something that I will for sure come into contact with again. So, I do hope to practice something like A2 again, although it was challenging. 

I'm beginning to understand the benefits of OOP, at least in Python. The code looks very clean, and simplified. I am also recognizing that the dot notation is something that I have used and seen before, and through forming Classes we are just able to create our own methods! Powerful stuff. 

Looking forward to the challenges of A3 and Java! I am hoping that I can continue to ask for help, and recognize that is okay to not know how to do something right away.
